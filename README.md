# elv-ingest-rb
A ruby wrapper for the elv-client-js Mezzanine creation process 

The elv-ingest gem is a ruby extension that wraps the mezzanine creation process provided in elv-client-js to allow its use from ruby.

Current version: elv-ingest-0.0.1.gem



Installation
--------------

- Install elv-client-js
	- go to the target location
		$ mkdir ~/ELV
		$ cd ~/ELV
	- pull the git branch for elv-client-js
		$ git clone git@github.com:eluv-io/elv-client-js.git
	- Switch to the 'master' branch
		$ git checkout master
	- Install the node dependencies
		$ npm install
	- test that the install works
		$ node testScripts/CreateProductionMaster.js --version

- install the ruby gem

	- download the gem

	- install the gem
		$ gem install <Path to where the gem was downloaded>/elv-ingest-0.0.1.gem


Use
-----

The process to create a playable mezzanine is done in several steps. First a production master must be created. The master object typically only references media files on Amazon. Once a master is created, a playable mezzanine file can be derived from it. Here is an example use:

$ irb
irb>


irb> require "elv-ingest"

irb> s3ingestor = Elv::Ingest.new({
    :private_key=>"0x THE ELUVIO PRIVATE KEY FOR THE CREATOR USER",
